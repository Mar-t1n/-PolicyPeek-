# AI Model Download Prompt Implementation

## Overview
Added a user-friendly download prompt that appears before attempting to download the Gemini Nano AI model. This ensures Chrome's user gesture requirement is met and provides clear communication to users about the AI features.

## What Was Added

### 1. HTML Structure (`analysis.html`)
- **New Section:** `download-prompt-section`
  - Robot emoji icon (ü§ñ)
  - Clear heading: "AI Model Download Available"
  - Explanation of what the AI does
  - **Warning message:** "‚ö†Ô∏è AI features of this extension won't work without this"
  - Download details (size: ~1.7 GB, one-time)
  - Two action buttons:
    - **"Download AI Model"** (primary) - Triggers download with user gesture
    - **"Skip (Use Basic Analysis)"** (secondary) - Continues without AI

### 2. CSS Styling (`analysis.css`)
- Styled download prompt card with centered layout
- Bouncing robot icon animation
- Yellow warning box for emphasis
- Large, prominent download button
- Responsive design matching the rest of the app

### 3. JavaScript Logic (`analysis.js`)

#### New State Variables
- `downloadPromptSection` - Reference to the download prompt DOM element
- `downloadModelBtn` - Download button reference
- `skipDownloadBtn` - Skip button reference
- `userSkippedDownload` - Flag to track if user declined download
- `window.pendingAnalysis` - Stores URL analysis info if interrupted by download prompt

#### Modified `initializePromptAPI()`
- Returns `'needs-download'` when model is downloadable (instead of attempting to create session)
- Checks `userSkippedDownload` flag to avoid re-prompting
- Only attempts session creation when model is `'readily'` available

#### Modified `init()`
- Checks for `'needs-download'` return value
- Shows download prompt instead of proceeding
- Stores pending analysis info for later continuation

#### New Event Handlers

**`handleDownloadModel()` - User clicks "Download AI Model":**
1. Disables button and shows "Downloading..." text
2. Shows loading section
3. Checks availability again
4. Creates `LanguageModel` session (with user gesture context) ‚úÖ
5. Monitors download progress
6. On success: Continues pending analysis or shows input section
7. On error: Shows error and allows retry

**`handleSkipDownload()` - User clicks "Skip":**
1. Sets `userSkippedDownload = true`
2. Sets `promptAvailable = false`
3. Continues with basic analysis (no AI)
4. Completes any pending URL analysis without AI

#### Updated `hideAll()`
- Now includes `downloadPromptSection` in sections to hide

## User Experience Flow

### First-Time User Journey

**When model needs download:**

1. User opens analysis page or clicks "Analyze" in popup
2. Extension checks AI availability ‚Üí `'downloadable'`
3. **Download prompt appears** with clear explanation
4. User sees two options:
   - Download AI Model (recommended)
   - Skip (basic analysis only)

**If user clicks "Download AI Model":**
1. Button click = user gesture ‚úÖ
2. Download starts automatically
3. Progress shown in loading screen
4. After download: Analysis continues with AI
5. Future uses: AI always available, no more prompts

**If user clicks "Skip":**
1. Continues without AI
2. Uses basic keyword analysis
3. Message explains AI is not available
4. User can reload page later to see download prompt again (unless they clear the flag)

### After Model Downloaded

- ‚úÖ No download prompt shown
- ‚úÖ AI works automatically for all analysis
- ‚úÖ Seamless experience

## Technical Implementation Details

### Gesture Requirement Solution
The download prompt button provides the required user gesture context:
- Chrome blocks automatic downloads (security feature)
- Button click event = valid user gesture
- `LanguageModel.create()` call succeeds when triggered by click

### State Management
- **`userSkippedDownload`**: Prevents re-showing prompt in same session
- **`window.pendingAnalysis`**: Stores URL params if analysis interrupted
- **`promptAvailable`**: Global flag for AI availability status

### Error Handling
- Catches download failures
- Shows user-friendly error messages
- Allows retry without reloading page
- Falls back to basic analysis if needed
