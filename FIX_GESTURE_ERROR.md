# Fix: Prompt API Gesture Error - Complete Solution

## Problem
The extension was showing two related issues:
1. **"Error initializing Prompt API: requires a gesture when availability is downloading or downloadable"**
2. **AI not being used** even when model is downloadable, falling back to basic analysis

## Root Cause
The Chrome Prompt API has specific requirements for downloading the Gemini Nano model:
- Requires a **user gesture** (like a button click) to trigger downloads
- Automatic page loads (like URL analysis from popup) don't count as user gestures
- The initial implementation was too restrictive, blocking session creation entirely

## Solution Strategy

### Approach: Try Optimistically, Handle Gracefully

1. **Always attempt** to create session during initialization
2. **Catch gesture errors** specifically and handle them
3. **Retry session creation** with actual user gestures (button clicks)
4. **Provide helpful feedback** when AI is unavailable

## Key Changes

### 1. Modified `initializePromptAPI()`
```javascript
// Before: Blocked session creation for 'downloadable'
if (availability === 'downloadable') {
  return false; // Too restrictive!
}

// After: Try to create session, handle errors gracefully
if (availability === 'downloadable' || availability === 'after-download') {
  console.log('Note: Model needs download - creating session will attempt to trigger download');
}
// Always attempt to create session
promptSession = await self.LanguageModel.create({...});
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
catch (error) {
  // Detect gesture-specific errors
  if (error.message && error.message.includes('gesture')) {
    console.log('⚠️ Model download requires user gesture - will retry on user action');
    return false; // Don't completely fail
  }
}
```

### 3. Retry Logic in `analyzeFromUrl()`
```javascript
// If AI wasn't initialized (gesture error), try again
if (!promptAvailable && !promptSession && 'LanguageModel' in self) {
  console.log('Retrying AI initialization for URL analysis...');
  // Attempt to create session - page load might count as gesture
  promptSession = await self.LanguageModel.create({...});
}
```

### 4. User-Friendly Fallback Messages
```javascript
summary += '\n*Note: AI-powered analysis is not currently available. This may be because:*\n';
summary += '- *The Gemini Nano model needs to be downloaded (try manual analysis page)*\n';
summary += '- *Chrome AI is not enabled (requires Chrome 138+ with AI features enabled)*\n';
```

## User Experience Flow

### First-Time User (Model Not Downloaded)

**Scenario A: Auto-analysis from popup**
1. User clicks "Analyze" in popup
2. Analysis page opens automatically
3. Tries to initialize AI → gesture error (page load isn't a click)
4. Retries on page load → might work, might not
5. Falls back to basic analysis with helpful message
6. **User can use manual analysis page to trigger download**

**Scenario B: Manual analysis page** ✅ Recommended
1. User opens manual analysis page
2. User clicks "Analyze Policy" button
3. Button click = user gesture ✅
4. Download triggers successfully
5. Progress shown
6. Analysis completes with AI

### After Model Downloaded
- ✅ All automatic analysis works
- ✅ Manual analysis works
- ✅ No more gesture errors
- ✅ AI is always available

## Testing Results

### Expected Behavior:
- **First load with downloadable model:**
  - ⚠️ May show basic analysis (gesture limitation)
  - ✅ Provides clear instructions to user
  - ✅ No crashes or errors
  
- **Manual analysis button click:**
  - ✅ Triggers download successfully
  - ✅ Shows progress
  - ✅ Completes analysis
  
- **After model downloaded:**
  - ✅ All analysis uses AI automatically
  - ✅ No fallback to basic analysis

## Chrome AI Requirements
- Chrome 138+ (Canary/Dev)
- Gemini Nano flags enabled
- Sufficient storage (~1.7 GB for model)
- **First-time:** User gesture required for download
- **After download:** Works automatically everywhere
